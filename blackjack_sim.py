##card array (tuple?, just values, need to deal with aces)

##auto-rules (e.g. 'when dealer shows X, player does Y')

##money betting mgmt scheme (e.g. '2123345')


### main question... at low stakes table, is there a sufficiently small stake s.t. you can "reliably" (high probability) win $200 (walk away) and 'earn a living' playing (non-cheating) blackjack?
